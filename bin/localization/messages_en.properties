chat.help=\nWhen you're ready to begin, press the "Start" option in the game menu.\n\nPlace your fleet of battleships onto the grid. Each player has five ships of different sizes: an aircraft carrier (5 spaces), battleship (4 spaces), cruiser (3 spaces), destroyer (3 spaces), and submarine (2 spaces).\n\nTo place a battleship, click on a grid tile where you want the head of the ship to be located. Right-clicking allows you to switch between horizontal and vertical orientations for the ship placement.\n\nYou and your opponent will alternate turns firing at each other's fleets.\nEach time you fire, your opponent will notify you whether you've hit a ship or not.\n\nIf you successfully hit all parts of one of your opponent's battleships, they must declare that the ship has sunk.\n\nContinue taking turns firing until either you or your opponent has sunk the entire fleet.\n\nThe game ends when you successfully sink your opponent's entire fleet.\n
